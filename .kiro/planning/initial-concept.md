# Initial Concept & Brainstorming

## 🎯 Problem Statement (Identified with Kiro)

During our initial Kiro session, we identified key pain points in the DeFi ecosystem:

1. **Trust Issues**: P2P transactions require intermediaries
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Permanent wallet addresses expose transaction history
3. **Multi-Chain Complexity**: Managing wallets across different networks is cumbersome
4. **User Experience**: DeFi platforms are not beginner-friendly
5. **Mobile Limitations**: Most DeFi platforms lack mobile-first features

## 💡 Solution Brainstorming (Kiro-Assisted)

### Session 1: Core Concept
**Kiro Prompt**: "Help me design a multi-chain wallet with escrow functionality"

**Kiro's Suggestions**:
- Implement smart contract-based escrow for trustless transactions
- Use ethers.js for blockchain interactions
- Consider temporary wallet feature for privacy
- Plan for multi-network support from the start

**Our Decision**: Build WalletX with all these features plus AI integration

### Session 2: Unique Features
**Kiro Prompt**: "What unique features can differentiate our wallet from competitors?"

**Kiro's Ideas**:
- ✅ Temporary disposable wallets (WORLD'S FIRST!)
- ✅ QR code integration for mobile users
- ✅ AI assistant for user guidance
- ✅ Email notifications via AWS SNS
- ✅ Unified multi-chain interface

### Session 3: Technical Feasibility
**Kiro Prompt**: "Evaluate the technical feasibility of implementing temporary wallets"

**Kiro's Analysis**:
- Use BIP39 for mnemonic generation
- Implement local storage for temporary wallets
- Add conversion feature to permanent wallets
- Ensure proper key management and security
