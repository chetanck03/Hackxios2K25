## 🎯 Project Overview
**Project Name**: WalletX - Revolutionary Multi-Chain AI Powered DeFi Platform  
**Hackathon**: HackXios 2K25  
**Track**: Kiro Prize Track - Most Creative Use of Kiro  
**Team**: Jai Mahakal 
**Live Demo**: https://walletx.software

## 🤖 How Kiro Was Used Throughout Development

### Phase 1: Initial Planning & Ideation
Kiro was instrumental in helping us brainstorm and structure the WalletX concept:
- Used Kiro's chat interface to explore multi-chain wallet architecture
- Leveraged Kiro to research best practices for temporary wallet implementation
- Planned the smart contract structure with Kiro's assistance
- Designed the 8-network integration strategy

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture
Kiro helped us design the technical stack and architecture:
- Evaluated different blockchain libraries (ethers.js vs web3.js)
- Planned the React component structure
- Designed the state management approach
- Architected the multi-chain RPC configuration

### Phase 3: Smart Contract Development
Used Kiro to:
- Draft initial Solidity smart contract code
- Review and optimize gas usage
- Plan escrow logic and security measures
- Structure contract deployment across 8 networks

### Phase 4: Frontend Implementation
Kiro assisted with:
- React component scaffolding
- TailwindCSS styling decisions
- Integration of QR code functionality
- AI assistant implementation planning

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing
Kiro helped with:
- Debugging blockchain connection issues
- Optimizing transaction flows
- Testing across multiple networks
- Error handling implementation
